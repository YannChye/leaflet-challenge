# leaflet-challenge

Completed leaflet (week 17) homework for Monash University Data Analytics Boot Camp.

Goal is to use leaflet to visualise earthquake and fault line data on a map. Earthquake data has been provided from the [United States Geological Survey](http://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/geojson.php). Fault line/tectonic plate data has been obtained from [https://github.com/fraxen/tectonicplates](https://github.com/fraxen/tectonicplates).

### Folder structure
* **Leaflet-Step-1** folder containing files for a basic visualisation of earthquake data
    * **index.html** page for basic visualisation
    * **/static/js/logic.js** javascript file 
    * **/static/css/style.css** stylesheet

* **Leaflet-Step-2** folder containing files for visualisation of earthquake data + tectonic plate as overlays
    * **index.html** page for visualisation
    * **/static/js/logic.js** javascript file 
    * **/static/css/style.css** stylesheet

### Requirement
* an API key to allow map generation from [mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com/), to be placed in a **/static/js/config.js** file
